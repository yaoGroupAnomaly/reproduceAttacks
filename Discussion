============= Instruction 2==============
For the gzip case, I added a few lines of code with vulnerability(buffer overflow) to the source file and then build the binary. Basically, I manually injected a vulnerability in it, which originally did not exist.

The CVE you found is probably a better option to reproduce, because then you can cite the CVE in your paper, which is much nicer than what i did. If you decide to go this route, make sure you pick the right version of vulnerable gzip. 

You probably also need to turn off ASLR in OS to have more predictable addresses.


------------
the gzip ROP:

I can use ROP to generate the gadgets but cannot run the program

I test the folder under your gzip_v5_rop_chain_context:

It keeps give me segmentation fault even though I just run a very small txt file

ketian@ketian:~/Desktop/gzip_v5_rop_chain_context$ ./allfile aaa
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

And it can detects the long file name:

ketian@ketian:~/Desktop/gzip_v5_rop_chain_context$ ./allfile  `python -c "print 'A'*1024"`
allfile: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA: file name too long

Is this the CVE your reproduce?

=============  Instruction 1 ===============

1)Do you have some instructions for reproducing these 4 attacks? 
2)The trace file is the ltrace file or the strace file?


The trace files should be strace, i.e. system call sequences.
This folder only contains the logged traces, not the exploitation itself.

For the backdoor and telnet cases, you can use metasploit (https://www.metasploit.com/)
It you haven't used it before, the file "attack-trace-context/backdoor-attack-context-strace/HowToExploit" contains step by step instructions.

The other 2 ROP exploits are produced using some open source ROP tools (such as this one: https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget)
Basically you need to
1. find all available gadgets in a vulnerable binary
2. find some gadgets that's useful for your attack and
3. construct a chain of gadgets which does what you want and can be executed sequentially and automatically, after a successful exploitation(such as buffer overflow)

I was testing ROP with gzip, but you can pick any other applications you want.
